Anyway, just some tips - KL has a better range of Air Asia trips, and if all does not go well, you can try using Singapore which is the hub for Tiger and JetStar Asia. Budget? If you're on the budget trip, 100 USD per week is manageable, without accounting for airfare and souvenirs of course. Land travel? No problem, lots of buses ply the usual tourist routes.

I currently have around 2 months of accumulated paid vacation days at my work and will be negotiating with my boss if I can take all of them consecutively. If not, the trip will just be around 3 weeks long. I currently don't have an itinerary yet but here is a list of the places I plan on visiting. If 3 weeks only: Tokyo Hong Kong Manila (possibly Puerto Galera as well) Singapore Bangkok Phuket If 1 month (including the ones above): Kuala Lumpur Siem Reap (Angkor ***) Kansai region (Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Himeji) If 2 months (including the ones listed above): Beijing Shanghai Xian ??? Seoul Bali Hanoi (Ha Long Bay) Macau ??? Ho Chi Minh City ??? Penang ??? Malacca ??? Kota Kinabalu ??? Since I will be going to Japan as well, I'm thinking of purchasing the All Asia Pass from Cathay Pacific. I'm also thinking of doing some overland travel as well (such as Singapore to Bangkok or Hong Kong to Beijing). Anyway, what are the places to see around Manila? I'm thinking of hiking around Northern Luzon to the Banaue Rice Terraces. How hard is it? It's been so long since I've been to the Philippines (around 10 years) so I don't really know what to expect. By the way, please post more stories and experiences while backpacking around Southeast Asia. Also post recommended hostels and things to do around the areas you've been to.

Travel and Leisure,Backpacking in Southeast Asia,,92,"Yes there is a south east asia package wherein you choose at least 3 cities and you get to ride the official carriers of those countries but there is a specific order of the cities. The better known travel agents in manila know about it. you know that getting a one way ticket is usually nealy equal the price of a one way if you go to pal or Sq. if you really want to spend less, go for the budget airlines cebu pacific, tiger or air asia which usually offer one way tickets which are really half the cost of a round trip. you can use tiger/cebpacific to singapore, go overland (train or bus) to KL then train to bangkok and return to Manila via Ceb pacific. Of course you shouldnt compare budget airline with the regular ones. (read on the threads re late flights, no food, no seating assignments etc..) But hey they are cheap and bring you to the same destination and that is what counts to some of us.if you dont have *****y or Obsessive compulsive travel mates who complain a lot then if OK. You can save a few bucks on hotels by travelling night time. We left Singapore at midnight and arrived KL at around 5am. There are various buses with fares ranging from 24 to 6 75 SGD. Pero even the cheapest is better than our buses in Manila. Usually 3 per row ang arrangement 1-aisle-2 seats. Train takes longer Sing to KL but arrives around 6. Di ka magaantay ng madaling araw. Immigration worries depends kung malas ka sa immig officer. its better if you have your ticket pabalik Manila even though it will not be from the country you are entering next.

Yun nga lang ako lang ang pinoy na nakikita ko dito tuloy napapagkamalan akong tagadito. hehehehe Masaya magbackpacking. Yung tipong 5 pirasong tshirt lang at 3 shorts ang dala mo. hehehe. buti na lang may laundry service ang mga guest houses pero sobrang mura lang naman. parang presyo din sa pinas ang palaba. Sunod punta kami ng Vang Vienne. Ok daw dun mas maraming turista. Nakakagulat nga dito sa Luang Prabang yung mga turista dun lang kumakain sa mga nakakariton na pagkain. Umuupo sa may kanal pero kain pa din sila. Siguro exotic sa kanila yun..**** pero kung sa pinas ko gagawin un yuck! Hehehehe... Di nga ko kumakain sa turo turo eh. pero dito since kasama ko tong mga nakilala ko sa Chiang Mai nahihiya naman akong tumanggi kumain dun. Dami ko kasi nakilala from Chiang Mai eh may British na chick, Australian addict, British na Indian, Swiss. etc. tapos dito sa Luang Prabang makikita kita kayo kasi maliit lang naman so sila makakasama mo kagimikan. Dapat marunong ka makisama. So sino ba naman ako para nde kumain sa may kanal! Hahahaha! Ok lang naman sana di sumakit tyan ko. Pero so far ok naman. Iniisip ko tuloy, bakit kaya sa pinas kahit sa mejo ok na Tapsihan di mo mapapkain ang mga puti or foreigners pero dito sa Laos at Thailand kahit na nakikita nilang may ipis sa loob ng restaurant kumakain pa din sila... Hehehe. nawalan nga ko ng gana nung nakakita ko ng daga na kasing laki ng pusa sa Chiang Mai. Madumi sa Chiang Mai pero bakit ang daming turista. Parang puro turista nga nakita ko konti lang ang mga Thai. Halos lahat turista. Dito sa Luang Prabang kahit mga naglalakad lang na may dalang bilao kinukunan ng picture ng mga turista. Ewan ko pero maganda naman sa mga lugar dito kaya lang iniisip ko meron din sa pinas nito kaya siguro bihira ang mga Pinoy na nagtatravel dito. Pero magandang experience yung makameet ka ng mga travellers from other countries. Masaya. Palitan kayo ng email, mobile number or kung may Facebook ka mas ok. Yun kasi ang uso sa mga puti. Hindi nila alam ang friendster. Mainit dito pero maraming mabibilan ng mineral water! Hehehehe. Tapos pwede ka magrent ng bike para maikot mo buong city. Siguro 1 day lang pwede na. Hopefullysa Vang Vienne eh mas ok. Report ko ulit kung ano ang experience ko dun. Sa mga nakakausap ko ayaw nila tumuloy ng Pinas kasi daw wala sa trail. Kelangan pa daw kasing mag travel by air. Binibida ko pa naman mga tourist spots natin. Sabi ko sa Hanoi or Macau sila lumipad para mura. Yung iba kasi from Bangkok ang return flight nila to their countries. Kaya mahirap daw. Sa mga nakapunta naman sa Pinas sabi nila the best daw ang Pinas sa mga pinunthan nila at mas friendly at madaling kausap mga tao. Syempre magaling tayo sa english. Putcha sa Chiang Mai ni hindi ako maintindihan nung money changer. Pano kaya napasok sa trabaho un eh puro foreigner dapat customer nya so dapat marunong sya magenglish kahit basic lang. Buti pa dito sa Luang Prabang *** mga nagbebenta ng bracelet eh magaling magenglish kasi nag-aaral daw sila sa school ng english. Anyways, iniisip ko lahat ng nandito meron din tayo. Kung may temple sila na luma may mga simbahan din tayong luma. Kaya lang bakit sa kanila ang dali mamasyal. Tapos may mga maps at mga tour packages pag dating mo mismo sa city. Sa pinas ba may mga libreng mapa din binibigay sa mga foreigners? Di ko kasi alam eh. Pero sa Chiang Mai parang isang malaking theme park. Lahat ng bahay na madaanan mo kung nde guest house, restaurant o kaya mamimigay ng tour package brochure. Hindi ka talaga mawawala. Ayun lang po mga observation ko pero ok na maexperience nating mga pinoy ang backpacking sa southeast asia, actually backpacking talaga dapat nde advisable magdala ka ng mga mamahaling maleta mo kasi baka singilin ka ng 2 tao sa bangka! Hehehe... Joke. Mas madali kasing kumilos pag backpack lang dala mo. Siguro sa arte na rin siguro ng mga pinoy sa pag travel kaya sila nde nagtatry magbackpack. usually kasi tayo kahit sa boracay lang pupunta grabe mga dala at magpapabook pa talaga ng accomodation in advance. Masyado tayong sigurista at maarte pag nagtravel. Kaya ayun, lessons learned na din sakin, sa kakapalit ko ng damit dahil maarte ako mag-ulit kahit shorts, ang mahal ng bayad ko sa pagpalaba ng maruming damit kasi ang dami. hehehehe... Hanggang dito muna... next time na ulit... mahal na bayad ko sa internet... hehehehe.bye",21-Jul-07,cool_egg,0.05,205,,,,,

Travel and Leisure,Backpacking in Southeast Asia,continuation...,99,"Last night ko sa Luang Prabang kagabi kaya nilubos na namin ang pagsasaya. Nung night before kasi nun birthday ko kaya di ako sumama sa biking and trekking tour diba kasi sabi sa ating mga pinoy pag birthday wag masyado gumawa ng delikado baka madisgrasya. Ayun pinabayaan ko na lang yung kasama ko na magbiking ako sinamahan ko na lang magtour sa city yung British girl na kaibigan ko na. Nagputa kami dun sa Kuangsi Falls na parang Daranak Falls din naman kung titingnan mo pero aliw na aliw ang mga puti na turista magswimming ng mga nakabikini at trunks lang.. hehehhee... After namin dun nagrest muna ko tapos nagdinner kami sinama namin yung friend namin na Amerikano from NY pero Italian heritage nya tapos nadaanan namin yung Indian-Brit sa kalsada ayun kumain ulit kami dun sa may kanal na buffet. Tapos tama naman andun *** mga Swiss boys na nakasabay namin sa Bangka galing Chiang Khong. Yung isa sa mga Swiss na un nakausap ko sabi nya 1 year na sya nagtatravel binenta daw nya lahat ng properties nya sa Switzerland para magtravel around the world. May 8 months pa daw sya bago bumalik sa Switzerland pero bahala na daw pano sya magstart ulit pagbalik nya. Balik sa kwento... So after dinner niyaya kami nitong mga Swiss sa Hive bar. Para lang syang Phi Bar or Aruba Bar sa Metrowalk pero ok na din. Dahil nga birthday ko nun, putcha lahat ng nakakalam na birthday ko binibilan ako ng isang bote ng Beerlao! Tapos yung isang Australian na kasama nung mga Swiss sa sobrang kalasingan bili sya ng bili ng shots ng Lao Lao *** whisky ng Laos tapos pinapashot ako, syempre di naman ako makatanggi.. Nagkataon naman meron ding isang may birthday dun Canadian naman sya kaya at least dalawa kami naghahati sa shots! hehehehe... Saya kasi parang random lang lahat ng pangyayari. Tapos hanggang 11pm lang *** bar pero may bowling alley dun sa LUang Prabang na hanggang 2am ang bukas... dun talaga ko nagtaka hehehe.. buti pa sila sa bayan nga namin kahit may Shopwise na wala pang 10pin bowling eh. Hahahaha... Anyways, sa sobrang kalasingan ko di ko alam kung tama *** mga email na nabigay ko sa kanila. bahala sila magsearch. pero *** mga email naman nila gumana kasi nahanap ko sa facebook. hehehehe.. The next day ganun ulit activities pero nagvisit ako ng mga temples di lang ako nakapagsimba kasi walang catholic church dito e. Kanina pumunta na *** sa Van Vieng pero the night before bumili na *** ng VIP ticket, sabi may luch daw saka magandang bus. TApos nagpaservice kami ng tuktuk para pickup *** sa guest house. Pagdating namin sa bus stop, wala na daw seats. Galit na galit *** mga puti kong kasama hehehe. Nagdeman ng refund. So suggestion lang pag aalis kayo ng Luang Prabang papuntang Vientiane or Van Vieng, wag na kayo pabook ng bus, first come first serve lang dun sa bus station. Kaya ayun ang nangyari umupa kami ng mini van parang Besta nagusap na lang kming mga nawalan ng upuan na kunin namin *** isang van. Malapit lang naman sa opposite lang ng bus station. Papuntang Van Vieng sobrang ganda ng view... Para din syang bundok na makikita mo sa Quezon Province pag pupunta ka Bicol pero madami lang cliffs at mga limestone formation. Mas maganda din kasi nde exploited ang mga bundok nila.. Sobrang green at ang fresh ng hangin.. Ayun sa dami ng zigzag pagod na pagod kami pero sulit naman kasi may mga stops naman para kumain. Ngayon eto na *** sa Van Vieng, pagdating dito hanap ng murang guest house, $4 *** nakuha namin per room na 2 single beds so split kami nung friend ko tig $2 ***. Sumama na din samin sa same guest house *** mga kasabay naming Isaraeli dalawang babae so mas masaya... Pagkaligo namin knina bigla naman umulan so di muna kami makalabas kaya naglaro muna kami ng cards sa common area. Tapos ayun nagdinner *** dito sa restaurant sa kanto. Ayos *** mga restaurant dito nakahiga kayo may unan pa pero ang palabas lang nila mga reruns ng FRIENDS hehehehe... Subtitled so iniiisip ko baka pirated copy! Hehehe.. Yung 2 restaurant na magkatapat pareho FRIENDS palabas... Mukhang *****. Ayun iniwan ko na muna sila at tumawid ako ng kalsada *** maginternet. At eto na ko ngayon... bye bye na ulit... Hayyy sarap magtagalog!!! English kasi ako ng english dito eh... Hehehe.. Nga pala. Kapag makikipag usap kayo sa mga locals it's better kung gamitan nyo ng English Carabao...Minsan ako ang nakikpagusap para maintindihan kasi nde marunong magenglish carabao tong mga kasama ko.. For example gusto nyo itanong: ""How much is the tuktuk going to the city?"" sabihin nyo... ""Tuktuk.. City... How much?"" Hahahaha!!! Bye bye!!! Next time ulit pag may experience na dito.. Ok daw *** tubing eh so masubukan bukas... Hehehe...",22-Jul-07,cool_egg,0.05,205,,,,,

Travel and Leisure,Backpacking in Southeast Asia,...continuation ng Laos backpacking ko..,101,"Kanina medyo late na kami nagising. Puyat kasi ng konti eh. Pero nagbreakfast kami mga 9am na tapos bacon and sausage naman kinain ko. Gusto ko sana ng Lao food kaso etong kasama ko ang arte ayaw na daw nya ng local food. Mga 10 am nagkita kita ulit kaming mga magkakasama sa guest house sa restaurant kung san kami kumain last night. I bet pag may nagpunta dito sa inyo makikita nyo kagad ang restaurant na to dahil sa kanto lang to. Ang Van Vieng kasi prang letter T lang ang kalsada. Lahat ng buhay nandun na. So madali lang lakarin end to end. Pero maulan dito kaya mejo hassle kami. So lunch na *** umali sa resto para puntahan *** TUBING. Wala talaga ko idea kung ano tong tubing na to so sumama lang ako. 40,000Kip ang presyo mejo ok na din. Mas mahal pa yung marijuana na tinira nung ksama namin kagabi. 100,000kip din un. Gusto ko sana magtry kaso may medical ako in the next few weeks eh. Hehehehe.. Sayang. Pero kinunan ko ng picture yung Special Menu tawag nila.. hehehe..Marijuan to the max.. Weed for the white people. Hehehe.. Akala ko naman kung ano yung tubing. Yun pala interior ng gulong ng truck lang na magpapalutang lutang ka sa ilog.. Pero ayos naman yung ilog nila saka walastik ang scenery. Wala ko masabi. Imaginin mo nasa El Nido ka nakikita mo yung mga cliffs ng limestone pero nagpapalutang lutang ka sa ilog na nakasakay sa interior ng gulong. Hehehe. Salababida pala tawag natin dun. Ang nakakatuwa lang habang nagpapalutang lutang ka, hahagisan ka ng kawayan ng mga locals tapos may mga bars sa tabi ng ilog pwede ka magswing pero bibili ka ng isang boteng Beerlao. Hehehe.. Mautak yata ko. Di na ko bumibili swing lang kagad ako. Hehehe.. Saya magswing tapos mahuhulog ka sa ilog. Tapos dadalin ka ng current pero kelangan mo magswim ulit papunta ng pampang kundi yari ka kasi madadala ka ng current. Ayun siguro naka 4 na stop *** sa mga bars tapos may volleyball court pa dun sa isang bar kaya ayun naglaro kami pero sa putikan nga lang. Hehehe.. After ng last bar na pinuntahan namin kung san may pinakamataas na swing nagpalutang na *** papunta sa end ng Tubing. Inabot na *** ng dilim pero pwede ka matulog kasi safe naman *** salbabida. Yun nga lang dapat magising ka sa end ng tubing kundi tuloy tuloy ka sa Mekong river. Hehehehe.. Eto pagod kami, kakaligo lang. Internet na naman. Tapos dinner. Sana maaga ko makatulog kasi pagod eh.. Hayyy. bukas kayak naman. Pero malapit na kami umuwi. Sana pwede pa ko magstay pero ayos lang. Saya naman. Bye...Nahihilo na ko sa mga katabi ko French ng French. Hehehe..",23-Jul-07,cool_egg,0.05,205,,,,,

Travel and Leisure,Backpacking in Southeast Asia,,103,"hey mickey! may kasama ko sa pagtravel etong European na kabigan ng bestfriend ko nameet ko sa singapore. kaya siguro malakas din loob ko kasi may kasama ko puti. mas OK kasi mas di maiilang sayo yung ibang travellers na magapproach. i suggest kung gusto nyo maging turista dito sa laos, mag-asta kang turista. magsuot ka ng damit pangturista wag yung maong at tshirt an usually getup ng mga pinoy sa ibang bansa. so pag lalaki tipong sando at boardshorts lang. pag babae paiklian ng damit. hehehe. pero yung mga puti kasi mahilig magsuot ng pantalon na nabibili sa thailand, yung tinutupi. so bahala ka na kung pano ka magmumukhang turista. magdala ka ng bag lagi at shades siguro naman epektib na un. pero kung may kasama kang puti mas madali. so makipagfriends ka sa mga makakasabay mo sa bus, bangka or tour packages. tanong tanong ka lang kung taga san sila, ano trabaho nila. tapos ayun kwento kwento. you'll be surprised na ang age ng mga travellers na andito mga 20-29 years old. i know madami satin mga pinoy sa ganong age di pa halos mahiwalay sa mga magulang pag nagtatravel. yung tipong kelangan pa ng tour packages. hehhee.. basta dala ka lang ng bag with damit, enough cash, passport at Lonely Planet book(eto pala importante para magmukha kang turista) hehehe... Back to my kwento.. kanina nagrent lang kami ng motorbike para puntahan yung mga caves. ayos naman pero parang mga kweba din natin sa pinas. iniisip ko tuloy sus kweba lang dinadayo pa ng mga puti.hehehe. pero astig kasi may mga buddha sa loob. yung sa hulig kweba pinuntahan namin mejo ok. kasi may lagoon na blue ang tubig.ang sarap maligo kasi ang lamig ng tubig. hehehe.. Nkalimutan ko yung tawag sa lugar pero parang sa P nagsisimula eh. ayos *** kweba dun pero 100 meters aakyatin mo bago ka makapasok sa entrance ng cave. hehehe. pababa mas mahirap yung nauuna sakin na babae ang taba nahulog nakakaawa nga kasi nasugatan. pero kasi ang taba nya dapat di na lang sya umakyat alam naman nya mahihirapan sya. papunta sa cave madadaanan mo yung pilapil pero sa di kalayuan makikita mo yung mga formation ng cliffs. yun ang the best sa view. so kung pupunta kayo dito advisable magrent ng motor kasi mura lang. hehehe. mga 40,000kip hanggang 8pm na un. iiwan nyo lang passport nyo tapos pirma ng contracat. ingat lang kasi sagot nyo lahat ng damage pag nasira. ngayon kakaligo ko lang tapos internet na naman para magkwento. bukas punta na *** Vientiane, capital ng Laos. pero konting oras lang kami dun tapos tuloy na Bangkok. kwento na lang ulit ako next time. sa question nga pala ni heymickey.. oo HOT na HOT ang mga Israelis! yung dalawa na naging friend na namin ok naman sila saka mabait. kakatapos lang nila ng military service nila kaya pinayagan sila ng parents nila magtravel. mdami sila dito. minsan di mo akalain israeli kasi ang puputi. so far yung dalawang kasama namin ok na ok. yung isa nga gusto nya pumunta sa pinas. sino gusto magtour sa kanya jan? hehehhe... sabi ko i will hook her up with my friends kung gusto nya pumunta ng manila.so any takers? baka wala kasi ako pinas pag punta nya this august. bye na ulit!",24-Jul-07,cool_egg,0.05,205,,,,,

Travel and Leisure,Backpacking in Southeast Asia,,105,"Well, not necessarily. I think it depends on the type of traveler a person is. A lot of Western people most likely wouldn't do it although some backpackers and the more adventurous people might. Plus, aside from being ""exotic"" to them, it's also about cost. A lot of these backpackers are in their 20's who are currently unemployed back home and who are traveling for 6 months to 2 years so they are also doing this to stretch their budget further.",25-Jul-07,heymikey,0.59,"3,342","Medyo off-topic, pero ako lang ba ang nakakapansin na tayong mga Pinoy tourists ay mas 'pihikan' sa ibang mga turista?

Travel and Leisure,Backpacking in Southeast Asia,,110,"Trust me, it is so much easier to get around mainland SE Asia than it is in mainland China. For one thing, the tourist trail is more apparent there than in China so it's much easier to get around. As for the language barrier, it's less of a problem in SE Asia than it is in mainland China. Besides, the language barrier is part of the ""exotic"" experience and you can look at it as part of the adventure. To make you feel better, there are thousands of young people who are barely out of school and can only speak English who backpack around SE Asia alone for several months, some even without a guidebook to help them out with the logistics and they seem to come out of the experience loving it.",31-Jul-07,heymikey,0.59,"3,342",haha.. sige 1 month na lang.
