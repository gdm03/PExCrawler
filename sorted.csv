Anyway, just some tips - KL has a better range of Air Asia trips, and if all does not go well, you can try using Singapore which is the hub for Tiger and JetStar Asia. Budget? If you're on the budget trip, 100 USD per week is manageable, without accounting for airfare and souvenirs of course. Land travel? No problem, lots of buses ply the usual tourist routes.

I currently have around 2 months of accumulated paid vacation days at my work and will be negotiating with my boss if I can take all of them consecutively. If not, the trip will just be around 3 weeks long. I currently don't have an itinerary yet but here is a list of the places I plan on visiting. If 3 weeks only: Tokyo Hong Kong Manila (possibly Puerto Galera as well) Singapore Bangkok Phuket If 1 month (including the ones above): Kuala Lumpur Siem Reap (Angkor ***) Kansai region (Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Himeji) If 2 months (including the ones listed above): Beijing Shanghai Xian ??? Seoul Bali Hanoi (Ha Long Bay) Macau ??? Ho Chi Minh City ??? Penang ??? Malacca ??? Kota Kinabalu ??? Since I will be going to Japan as well, I'm thinking of purchasing the All Asia Pass from Cathay Pacific. I'm also thinking of doing some overland travel as well (such as Singapore to Bangkok or Hong Kong to Beijing). Anyway, what are the places to see around Manila? I'm thinking of hiking around Northern Luzon to the Banaue Rice Terraces. How hard is it? It's been so long since I've been to the Philippines (around 10 years) so I don't really know what to expect. By the way, please post more stories and experiences while backpacking around Southeast Asia. Also post recommended hostels and things to do around the areas you've been to.

Travel and Leisure,Backpacking in Southeast Asia,,92,"Yes there is a south east asia package wherein you choose at least 3 cities and you get to ride the official carriers of those countries but there is a specific order of the cities. The better known travel agents in manila know about it. you know that getting a one way ticket is usually nealy equal the price of a one way if you go to pal or Sq. if you really want to spend less, go for the budget airlines cebu pacific, tiger or air asia which usually offer one way tickets which are really half the cost of a round trip. you can use tiger/cebpacific to singapore, go overland (train or bus) to KL then train to bangkok and return to Manila via Ceb pacific. Of course you shouldnt compare budget airline with the regular ones. (read on the threads re late flights, no food, no seating assignments etc..) But hey they are cheap and bring you to the same destination and that is what counts to some of us.if you dont have *****y or Obsessive compulsive travel mates who complain a lot then if OK. You can save a few bucks on hotels by travelling night time. We left Singapore at midnight and arrived KL at around 5am. There are various buses with fares ranging from 24 to 6 75 SGD. Pero even the cheapest is better than our buses in Manila. Usually 3 per row ang arrangement 1-aisle-2 seats. Train takes longer Sing to KL but arrives around 6. Di ka magaantay ng madaling araw. Immigration worries depends kung malas ka sa immig officer. its better if you have your ticket pabalik Manila even though it will not be from the country you are entering next.

Yun nga lang ako lang ang pinoy na nakikita ko dito tuloy napapagkamalan akong tagadito. hehehehe Masaya magbackpacking. Yung tipong 5 pirasong tshirt lang at 3 shorts ang dala mo. hehehe. buti na lang may laundry service ang mga guest houses pero sobrang mura lang naman. parang presyo din sa pinas ang palaba. Sunod punta kami ng Vang Vienne. Ok daw dun mas maraming turista. Nakakagulat nga dito sa Luang Prabang yung mga turista dun lang kumakain sa mga nakakariton na pagkain. Umuupo sa may kanal pero kain pa din sila. Siguro exotic sa kanila yun..**** pero kung sa pinas ko gagawin un yuck! Hehehehe... Di nga ko kumakain sa turo turo eh. pero dito since kasama ko tong mga nakilala ko sa Chiang Mai nahihiya naman akong tumanggi kumain dun. Dami ko kasi nakilala from Chiang Mai eh may British na chick, Australian addict, British na Indian, Swiss. etc. tapos dito sa Luang Prabang makikita kita kayo kasi maliit lang naman so sila makakasama mo kagimikan. Dapat marunong ka makisama. So sino ba naman ako para nde kumain sa may kanal! Hahahaha! Ok lang naman sana di sumakit tyan ko. Pero so far ok naman. Iniisip ko tuloy, bakit kaya sa pinas kahit sa mejo ok na Tapsihan di mo mapapkain ang mga puti or foreigners pero dito sa Laos at Thailand kahit na nakikita nilang may ipis sa loob ng restaurant kumakain pa din sila... Hehehe. nawalan nga ko ng gana nung nakakita ko ng daga na kasing laki ng pusa sa Chiang Mai. Madumi sa Chiang Mai pero bakit ang daming turista. Parang puro turista nga nakita ko konti lang ang mga Thai. Halos lahat turista. Dito sa Luang Prabang kahit mga naglalakad lang na may dalang bilao kinukunan ng picture ng mga turista. Ewan ko pero maganda naman sa mga lugar dito kaya lang iniisip ko meron din sa pinas nito kaya siguro bihira ang mga Pinoy na nagtatravel dito. Pero magandang experience yung makameet ka ng mga travellers from other countries. Masaya. Palitan kayo ng email, mobile number or kung may Facebook ka mas ok. Yun kasi ang uso sa mga puti. Hindi nila alam ang friendster. Mainit dito pero maraming mabibilan ng mineral water! Hehehehe. Tapos pwede ka magrent ng bike para maikot mo buong city. Siguro 1 day lang pwede na. Hopefullysa Vang Vienne eh mas ok. Report ko ulit kung ano ang experience ko dun. Sa mga nakakausap ko ayaw nila tumuloy ng Pinas kasi daw wala sa trail. Kelangan pa daw kasing mag travel by air. Binibida ko pa naman mga tourist spots natin. Sabi ko sa Hanoi or Macau sila lumipad para mura. Yung iba kasi from Bangkok ang return flight nila to their countries. Kaya mahirap daw. Sa mga nakapunta naman sa Pinas sabi nila the best daw ang Pinas sa mga pinunthan nila at mas friendly at madaling kausap mga tao. Syempre magaling tayo sa english. Putcha sa Chiang Mai ni hindi ako maintindihan nung money changer. Pano kaya napasok sa trabaho un eh puro foreigner dapat customer nya so dapat marunong sya magenglish kahit basic lang. Buti pa dito sa Luang Prabang *** mga nagbebenta ng bracelet eh magaling magenglish kasi nag-aaral daw sila sa school ng english. Anyways, iniisip ko lahat ng nandito meron din tayo. Kung may temple sila na luma may mga simbahan din tayong luma. Kaya lang bakit sa kanila ang dali mamasyal. Tapos may mga maps at mga tour packages pag dating mo mismo sa city. Sa pinas ba may mga libreng mapa din binibigay sa mga foreigners? Di ko kasi alam eh. Pero sa Chiang Mai parang isang malaking theme park. Lahat ng bahay na madaanan mo kung nde guest house, restaurant o kaya mamimigay ng tour package brochure. Hindi ka talaga mawawala. Ayun lang po mga observation ko pero ok na maexperience nating mga pinoy ang backpacking sa southeast asia, actually backpacking talaga dapat nde advisable magdala ka ng mga mamahaling maleta mo kasi baka singilin ka ng 2 tao sa bangka! Hehehe... Joke. Mas madali kasing kumilos pag backpack lang dala mo. Siguro sa arte na rin siguro ng mga pinoy sa pag travel kaya sila nde nagtatry magbackpack. usually kasi tayo kahit sa boracay lang pupunta grabe mga dala at magpapabook pa talaga ng accomodation in advance. Masyado tayong sigurista at maarte pag nagtravel. Kaya ayun, lessons learned na din sakin, sa kakapalit ko ng damit dahil maarte ako mag-ulit kahit shorts, ang mahal ng bayad ko sa pagpalaba ng maruming damit kasi ang dami. hehehehe... Hanggang dito muna... next time na ulit... mahal na bayad ko sa internet... hehehehe.bye",21-Jul-07,cool_egg,0.05,205,,,,,

Travel and Leisure,Backpacking in Southeast Asia,continuation...,99,"Last night ko sa Luang Prabang kagabi kaya nilubos na namin ang pagsasaya. Nung night before kasi nun birthday ko kaya di ako sumama sa biking and trekking tour diba kasi sabi sa ating mga pinoy pag birthday wag masyado gumawa ng delikado baka madisgrasya. Ayun pinabayaan ko na lang yung kasama ko na magbiking ako sinamahan ko na lang magtour sa city yung British girl na kaibigan ko na. Nagputa kami dun sa Kuangsi Falls na parang Daranak Falls din naman kung titingnan mo pero aliw na aliw ang mga puti na turista magswimming ng mga nakabikini at trunks lang.. hehehhee... After namin dun nagrest muna ko tapos nagdinner kami sinama namin yung friend namin na Amerikano from NY pero Italian heritage nya tapos nadaanan namin yung Indian-Brit sa kalsada ayun kumain ulit kami dun sa may kanal na buffet. Tapos tama naman andun *** mga Swiss boys na nakasabay namin sa Bangka galing Chiang Khong. Yung isa sa mga Swiss na un nakausap ko sabi nya 1 year na sya nagtatravel binenta daw nya lahat ng properties nya sa Switzerland para magtravel around the world. May 8 months pa daw sya bago bumalik sa Switzerland pero bahala na daw pano sya magstart ulit pagbalik nya. Balik sa kwento... So after dinner niyaya kami nitong mga Swiss sa Hive bar. Para lang syang Phi Bar or Aruba Bar sa Metrowalk pero ok na din. Dahil nga birthday ko nun, putcha lahat ng nakakalam na birthday ko binibilan ako ng isang bote ng Beerlao! Tapos yung isang Australian na kasama nung mga Swiss sa sobrang kalasingan bili sya ng bili ng shots ng Lao Lao *** whisky ng Laos tapos pinapashot ako, syempre di naman ako makatanggi.. Nagkataon naman meron ding isang may birthday dun Canadian naman sya kaya at least dalawa kami naghahati sa shots! hehehehe... Saya kasi parang random lang lahat ng pangyayari. Tapos hanggang 11pm lang *** bar pero may bowling alley dun sa LUang Prabang na hanggang 2am ang bukas... dun talaga ko nagtaka hehehe.. buti pa sila sa bayan nga namin kahit may Shopwise na wala pang 10pin bowling eh. Hahahaha... Anyways, sa sobrang kalasingan ko di ko alam kung tama *** mga email na nabigay ko sa kanila. bahala sila magsearch. pero *** mga email naman nila gumana kasi nahanap ko sa facebook. hehehehe.. The next day ganun ulit activities pero nagvisit ako ng mga temples di lang ako nakapagsimba kasi walang catholic church dito e. Kanina pumunta na *** sa Van Vieng pero the night before bumili na *** ng VIP ticket, sabi may luch daw saka magandang bus. TApos nagpaservice kami ng tuktuk para pickup *** sa guest house. Pagdating namin sa bus stop, wala na daw seats. Galit na galit *** mga puti kong kasama hehehe. Nagdeman ng refund. So suggestion lang pag aalis kayo ng Luang Prabang papuntang Vientiane or Van Vieng, wag na kayo pabook ng bus, first come first serve lang dun sa bus station. Kaya ayun ang nangyari umupa kami ng mini van parang Besta nagusap na lang kming mga nawalan ng upuan na kunin namin *** isang van. Malapit lang naman sa opposite lang ng bus station. Papuntang Van Vieng sobrang ganda ng view... Para din syang bundok na makikita mo sa Quezon Province pag pupunta ka Bicol pero madami lang cliffs at mga limestone formation. Mas maganda din kasi nde exploited ang mga bundok nila.. Sobrang green at ang fresh ng hangin.. Ayun sa dami ng zigzag pagod na pagod kami pero sulit naman kasi may mga stops naman para kumain. Ngayon eto na *** sa Van Vieng, pagdating dito hanap ng murang guest house, $4 *** nakuha namin per room na 2 single beds so split kami nung friend ko tig $2 ***. Sumama na din samin sa same guest house *** mga kasabay naming Isaraeli dalawang babae so mas masaya... Pagkaligo namin knina bigla naman umulan so di muna kami makalabas kaya naglaro muna kami ng cards sa common area. Tapos ayun nagdinner *** dito sa restaurant sa kanto. Ayos *** mga restaurant dito nakahiga kayo may unan pa pero ang palabas lang nila mga reruns ng FRIENDS hehehehe... Subtitled so iniiisip ko baka pirated copy! Hehehe.. Yung 2 restaurant na magkatapat pareho FRIENDS palabas... Mukhang *****. Ayun iniwan ko na muna sila at tumawid ako ng kalsada *** maginternet. At eto na ko ngayon... bye bye na ulit... Hayyy sarap magtagalog!!! English kasi ako ng english dito eh... Hehehe.. Nga pala. Kapag makikipag usap kayo sa mga locals it's better kung gamitan nyo ng English Carabao...Minsan ako ang nakikpagusap para maintindihan kasi nde marunong magenglish carabao tong mga kasama ko.. For example gusto nyo itanong: ""How much is the tuktuk going to the city?"" sabihin nyo... ""Tuktuk.. City... How much?"" Hahahaha!!! Bye bye!!! Next time ulit pag may experience na dito..

Travel and Leisure,Backpacking in Southeast Asia,...continuation ng Laos backpacking ko..,101,"Kanina medyo late na kami nagising. Puyat kasi ng konti eh. Pero nagbreakfast kami mga 9am na tapos bacon and sausage naman kinain ko. Gusto ko sana ng Lao food kaso etong kasama ko ang arte ayaw na daw nya ng local food. Mga 10 am nagkita kita ulit kaming mga magkakasama sa guest house sa restaurant kung san kami kumain last night. I bet pag may nagpunta dito sa inyo makikita nyo kagad ang restaurant na to dahil sa kanto lang to. Ang Van Vieng kasi prang letter T lang ang kalsada. Lahat ng buhay nandun na. So madali lang lakarin end to end. Pero maulan dito kaya mejo hassle kami. So lunch na *** umali sa resto para puntahan *** TUBING. Wala talaga ko idea kung ano tong tubing na to so sumama lang ako. 40,000Kip ang presyo mejo ok na din. Mas mahal pa yung marijuana na tinira nung ksama namin kagabi. 100,000kip din un. Gusto ko sana magtry kaso may medical ako in the next few weeks eh. Hehehehe.. Sayang. Pero kinunan ko ng picture yung Special Menu tawag nila.. hehehe..Marijuan to the max.. Weed for the white people. Hehehe.. Akala ko naman kung ano yung tubing. Yun pala interior ng gulong ng truck lang na magpapalutang lutang ka sa ilog.. Pero ayos naman yung ilog nila saka walastik ang scenery. Wala ko masabi. Imaginin mo nasa El Nido ka nakikita mo yung mga cliffs ng limestone pero nagpapalutang lutang ka sa ilog na nakasakay sa interior ng gulong. Hehehe. Salababida pala tawag natin dun. Ang nakakatuwa lang habang nagpapalutang lutang ka, hahagisan ka ng kawayan ng mga locals tapos may mga bars sa tabi ng ilog pwede ka magswing pero bibili ka ng isang boteng Beerlao. Hehehe.. Mautak yata ko. Di na ko bumibili swing lang kagad ako. Hehehe.. Saya magswing tapos mahuhulog ka sa ilog. Tapos dadalin ka ng current pero kelangan mo magswim ulit papunta ng pampang kundi yari ka kasi madadala ka ng current. Ayun siguro naka 4 na stop *** sa mga bars tapos may volleyball court pa dun sa isang bar kaya ayun naglaro kami pero sa putikan nga lang. Hehehe.. After ng last bar na pinuntahan namin kung san may pinakamataas na swing nagpalutang na *** papunta sa end ng Tubing. Inabot na *** ng dilim pero pwede ka matulog kasi safe naman *** salbabida. Yun nga lang dapat magising ka sa end ng tubing kundi tuloy tuloy ka sa Mekong river. Hehehehe.. Eto pagod kami, kakaligo lang. Internet na naman. Tapos dinner. Sana maaga ko makatulog kasi pagod eh.. Hayyy. bukas kayak naman. Pero malapit na kami umuwi. Sana pwede pa ko magstay pero ayos lang. Saya naman.

Travel and Leisure,Backpacking in Southeast Asia,,103,"hey mickey! may kasama ko sa pagtravel etong European na kabigan ng bestfriend ko nameet ko sa singapore. kaya siguro malakas din loob ko kasi may kasama ko puti. mas OK kasi mas di maiilang sayo yung ibang travellers na magapproach. i suggest kung gusto nyo maging turista dito sa laos, mag-asta kang turista. magsuot ka ng damit pangturista wag yung maong at tshirt an usually getup ng mga pinoy sa ibang bansa. so pag lalaki tipong sando at boardshorts lang. pag babae paiklian ng damit. hehehe. pero yung mga puti kasi mahilig magsuot ng pantalon na nabibili sa thailand, yung tinutupi. so bahala ka na kung pano ka magmumukhang turista. magdala ka ng bag lagi at shades siguro naman epektib na un. pero kung may kasama kang puti mas madali. so makipagfriends ka sa mga makakasabay mo sa bus, bangka or tour packages. tanong tanong ka lang kung taga san sila, ano trabaho nila. tapos ayun kwento kwento. you'll be surprised na ang age ng mga travellers na andito mga 20-29 years old. i know madami satin mga pinoy sa ganong age di pa halos mahiwalay sa mga magulang pag nagtatravel. yung tipong kelangan pa ng tour packages. hehhee.. basta dala ka lang ng bag with damit, enough cash, passport at Lonely Planet book(eto pala importante para magmukha kang turista) hehehe... Back to my kwento.. kanina nagrent lang kami ng motorbike para puntahan yung mga caves. ayos naman pero parang mga kweba din natin sa pinas. iniisip ko tuloy sus kweba lang dinadayo pa ng mga puti.hehehe. pero astig kasi may mga buddha sa loob. yung sa hulig kweba pinuntahan namin mejo ok. kasi may lagoon na blue ang tubig.ang sarap maligo kasi ang lamig ng tubig. hehehe.. Nkalimutan ko yung tawag sa lugar pero parang sa P nagsisimula eh. ayos *** kweba dun pero 100 meters aakyatin mo bago ka makapasok sa entrance ng cave. hehehe. pababa mas mahirap yung nauuna sakin na babae ang taba nahulog nakakaawa nga kasi nasugatan. pero kasi ang taba nya dapat di na lang sya umakyat alam naman nya mahihirapan sya. papunta sa cave madadaanan mo yung pilapil pero sa di kalayuan makikita mo yung mga formation ng cliffs. yun ang the best sa view. so kung pupunta kayo dito advisable magrent ng motor kasi mura lang. hehehe. mga 40,000kip hanggang 8pm na un. iiwan nyo lang passport nyo tapos pirma ng contracat. ingat lang kasi sagot nyo lahat ng damage pag nasira. ngayon kakaligo ko lang tapos internet na naman para magkwento. bukas punta na *** Vientiane, capital ng Laos. pero konting oras lang kami dun tapos tuloy na Bangkok. kwento na lang ulit ako next time. sa question nga pala ni heymickey.. oo HOT na HOT ang mga Israelis! yung dalawa na naging friend na namin ok naman sila saka mabait. kakatapos lang nila ng military service nila kaya pinayagan sila ng parents nila magtravel. mdami sila dito. minsan di mo akalain israeli kasi ang puputi. so far yung dalawang kasama namin ok na ok. yung isa nga gusto nya pumunta sa pinas. sino gusto magtour sa kanya jan? hehehhe... sabi ko i will hook her up with my friends kung gusto nya pumunta ng manila.so any takers? baka wala kasi ako pinas pag punta nya this august. bye na ulit!",24-Jul-07,cool_egg,0.05,205,,,,,

Besides, the language barrier is part of the ""exotic"" experience and you can look at it as part of the adventure.

Since free naman and andun ang mga tropa we stayed the remaining days in Trezzo Very cheap place but more importantly the place is totally secured. Mabait ang caretaker and may kitchen and internet connection (Just ask nicely) Kung hindi naman kayo maarte sa place at gusto nyo sa beach front na cheaper price you can try Amihan or Aliya. Usually ito yun mga transient na tinutuluyan ng mga foreigners/professional surfers. Good advice is when you go out far away or mag-swim sa beach kelangan may kasama kayo na local.

Travel and Leisure,"Baler, Aurora",,102,"I was bored in the city so I thought of going to Baler last Feb. I say it's one of the most amazing places to see. On the Road I took the first Genesis Bus trip at Cubao around 530am. Adventure started on the road along Sierra Madre. If you like mountainscape, then you'll love the area when you reached the Pantabangan Dam, the Sierra Madre mountain ranges, and there's a small dam near Nueva Vizcaya. It took me an 8-hour bus drive! I never expected the route will be via Nueva Vizcaya. The driver told me that they don't take the Cabanatuan-Baler road as it's more prone to landslide and road is more steep. But the view is great. Day 1: First surfing lesson Charlie Does offers an inexpensive tutorials for first-time surfers. I think it was just P400 per hour. Though I didn't get to balance my feet on the waves that much (20 out of 100 attempts!) the whole experience will always be memorable. The tutors are friendly and very patient. Stay at Bahia de Baler Though it's more expensive than Bay's Inn, a P2000 pax/night won't hurt that much. I think my expectation was low before I get there, that's why I was impressed by their facilities and services -- not expected of a hotel from a far-flung town. However, I always eat at Bay's Inn. If you're a lone traveller, I'm sure you'll meet new friends there. Day 2: Baler Tour In Charlie Does, they offer not only surfing lessons, but also tour services. They offer P500 for half day, and P800 for whole-day tour. I chose just the half-day tour, and riding on a tricycle, I toured the must-see spots of Baler: - Ermita Hill - Tromba Marina - Baler Fishport - Lukso-Lukso Islets - Cemento Beach - The oldest Balete tree - Baler Church Going Back to Manila Hopped in the 130pm schedule of Genesis to Manila. Arrived in Manila around 830pm. Conclusion I will definitely go back to Baler. I think its better to go here during the cold months than during summer.",30-Mar-11,freethinkee,0.03,72,,,,,

Travel and Leisure,"Baler, Aurora",,296,"I still have a lot of things I wanna write concerning my trips prior to Aurora but I wanna do this one first as I know that there will be so many people who will heeding to Baler and I don't want them to experience the same inconvenience I encountered booking for a place to stay. Our trip was last weekend, yeah, April 6-8 and it was HOLY WEEK in the Philippines so looking for an accommodation was indeed a pain in the neck.I texted so many resorts along Sabang Beach two weeks before our scheduled tour but to no avail.Some even replied that they are already fully booked for the entire month of April. That's good because it means tourism in Aurora is really picking up. But that meant bad news for me and my friends who have been dying to try surfing and whose vacation is pegged at local holidays. Good thing I didn't give up, until I saw one discussion over Pinoy Exchange where a fellow travel blogger, Marx of http://www.marxtermind.com/ posted something on the topic.I immediately contacted Marx and I was relieved when i learned that the place he found also online has another room available. It was more of a desperate move in my case. Bawal na ang choosy. What I am saying is, I usually google for the place and try to inspect the photos before I decide, but on this occasion, I just texted the owner, Mr Vincent and the rest is up to faith. I couldn't even remember the name of the place. But after staying there for 3days,2nights, how can I ever forget KL JAVERS Homestay in Baler Aurora....... First of all, I thought we are going to end up in a rundown accommodation.

However, the place can accommodate ""barkadas"" of 7-10 - kung koboy ang magbabarkada. You and your family or barkada can cook your own food and eat at our spacious dining room (you can request to light the fire place to keep you warm during the 12-degree nights) overlooking the heart of the City of Pines. After dinner or before going to bed you can also lounge at our sala at the warmth of its fire place and enjoy the overlooking site of Baguio City.

And if you have time, drop by Jack 's--it's a restaurant. Try their chicken, tastes like Max's. And they're very cheap, too. -- For souvenirs and pasalubong, La Trinidad and Mines View provide better prices. Just don't forget to haggle. Of course, don't forget Good Shepherd for Mountain Maid products. -- For overruns, drop by Camp John Hay's Mile High Inn. -- And don't forget to drop by SM, if only for the view.",18-Nov-05,lite,0.35,"2,030",,,,,

Advantages: 1. relatively cheap @ 1,500 / night for a standard room 2. the street where it's at (Legarda Road) is not congested at all, unlike the ones around Burnham Park 3. lots of good restaurants nearby, best of which is Matutina's (best sisig, bangus belly and roasted hito that i've ever tried!) Disadvantages: 1. when you rotate the hot or the cold shower knob, the temperature of the water doesn't react instantaneuosly (it takes 2-3 seconds to do so ) 2. the desk attendant tried to charge us 500 pesos more when we checked out (not gonna be problem if you clarify the cost upon check-in).

Travel and Leisure,"Baguio: ""City of Pines""",,407,"I love going to Baguio to spend some R&R there.... I like eating at the Batirol resto near the skating rink in Camp John Hay... The only thing I hate was SM Baguio!!!!! I went there to buy medicines because my wife got sick while on vacation and found out that there basement parking had no exhaust system!!!! The parking was almost full to the brim, the only space available was in the second basement and when I got down my car I could barely breathe through all the exhaust fumes made by all those cars.... I got a chance to talk to one of the supermarket employees who was in-charge of the grocery bags pick-up point... She was only wearing a towel around her nose and mouth... I asked her if SM provides her with proper .95 micron filter and she told me that she only had her towel to protect her...

Travel and Leisure,"Baguio: ""City of Pines""",,409,"Just got back from Baguio. Stayed at the Benguet Prime Hotel, this is the one right above Jollibee Session Rd. PhP 1500/night, basic room with matrimonial bed. Walang kwenta nga lang yung hot/cold shower nila, napakahina! Parang tumutulo lang. Pero location kasi yung importante sa amin nun. May free bfast, pero good until 1030 am lang, kaya ni-minsan hindi namin naabutan. Food naman, dropped by Volante, pangit ang ambience and ang tagal kami binigyan ng menu. Pero otherwise, masarap naman. Pero ang pinakamasarap na nakain ko sa Bario Fiesta sa Session Rd extension, a 2 minute walk from SM. Dun sa may mga malalaking statues. Yung second resto yata siya, kung pababa ka ng stairs. I really liked the Bario Fiesta rice (yung may crabs) - PhP 200, good for 2 or 3 peeps. Stay away from Gobi Session Rd. Cheap, pero ang pangit ng service. Nung andun kami, 6 kami and nung sinimulan na ilagay yung mga spoons and forks, inayos lang yung sa 2 tao tapos iniwan na sa head ng mesa. Tapos nung ngserve ng mga pagkain, basta lang nilalagay sa head ng table. Kami pa nag-aabot. Nung humingi pa kami ng tubig, talagang binabagsak ang baso sa harap namin. Tapos bottomless ang iced tea namin, kapag nagpaparefill, talanga pinupuno pa to the brim. Ayaw man lang ngumiti ng waitress, kapag tinatawag parang galit ang mukha. Kung gusto niyo na cheap and mura na pagkain, try niyo ang classic food nung college kami sa UPB - yung buttered chicken ng Cathy's - dun sa terminal ng Hillside/PNR. Baba lang kayo patungo ng Harrison/Burnham from Session Rd - sa side ng Mcdo, and yung unang kalsada on your left, dun na yun. Hindi nga lang maganda yung place, kaya mas-maganda i-take out nalang. Pero price-wise, and sa sarap, wala nang tatalo pa. Meron rin masarap na buttered chicken sa Burnham Hotel. Mas-pricey nga lang. Pero I think it's still cheap. Tried the Victory Liner Deluxe Bus, PhP550, ~12:45am umalis, arrived in Pasay ~ 4:45am. Mabilis talaga. You get lots of space. Non-stop. May CR sa loob, pero hindi ko na nagamit and mabaho nga lang daw sabi ng kasama ko. Pero sobrang lamig ng air-con!!!! I cannot stress this enough!!! 3 na kaming nag-reklamo pero wala na daw magagawa sabi ng stewardess. Yung isang tao, nagpalipat pa sa likod kasi hindi niya matiis ang lamig. Mas-malamig pa kaysa sa regular na aircon na bus. Naka-2 jacket na ako and nag-suot pa ako ng 2 medyas. Seriously! Talagang hindi ako nakatulog dahil sa lamig. And trust me, sanay ako sa -10 C na weather.",19-Dec-06,LittleTotoy,0.02,85,,,,,

Travel and Leisure,"Baguio: ""City of Pines""",,446,"Force Heritage Sites (BTFHS) to negotiate in behalf of the City Government for the transfer of the Casa Vallejo Building to the city in preparation for the celebration of the city's centennial in 2009.

Being one of the oldest remaining structures, Casa Vallejo once served as a detention center in 1917, a hotel in 1923, a British and Indian refugee center in 1940, and a temporary school site for students of the Baguio City High School (BCHS) in 1945. Casa Vallejo is also one of the structures that survived massive bombing by the Japanese forces during World War II. (RO) (July 12, 2006 issue)",20-Jan-07,maverick2005,3.96,"16,731",,,,,

Travel and Leisure,"Baguio: ""City of Pines""",im back from baguio,457,"saya! ang sarap. im with my special someone kaya ok... by the way, nag stay kami sa inn rocio and okay naman sya. 938php lang yung room. dumating kasi kami ng maaga, na dapat 12pm pa. the attendant was pleasant and she offered us the sheaper room na available kasi baka pagod na daw kami. di naman ako nag expect ng malaking or eleganteng kwarto kasi nga mura lang.. pero nakuha ko gusto ko. ayaw ko kasi ng hotel type talaga e. gusto ko yung may pagka bahay yung ambiance, para baguio na baguio. went to different parks and places. like Botanical garden - sa leonard wood road to. tapat ng dating shop ng pilak. this is also near safari lodge/hunters bar. ok dito, konti tao and ok ang arrangement ng plants. to go here, taxi ang pinaka madali pero kung jeep sa session road ka sumakay ng jeep papuntang mines view. 7.50php lang pamasahe.. Wright park - kung trip mong mag kabayo-kabayo, from botanical garden e lakarin mo na lang... madadaanan mo pa ang simbahan kung saan kinasal si aga at charlene gonzalez hehe.. (paakyat ng leonard wood ang lakad mo ha..) dito rin may mga pinaka murang plants/flowers/cactus na binebenta.. kung icocompare kasi ang prices ng plants na binebenta dito sa plants sa mines view at sm e mas mura sila dito ng 20-40php. pati nga miryenda mas mura dito e.. banana que dito 5 pesos 2 piraso sa mines view 12 pesos.. hehe The Mansion - from wright park, akyatin mo yung saksakan ng taas ng hagdaan.. sa tuktok nun may toilet (hehe) tapos lakarin mo hanggang dun sa may pabilog na garden.. ikutin mo yung garden na pabilog at matatanaw mo na ang the mansion. mabait yun batay dito na militar guy.. binebentahan pa nga kami ng hammock (kasama 2 pine tree ) Mines View - so from session road, sakay ka ng jeep na may naka sulat na mines view 8.50php lang ang bayad.. kung taxi aabutin ka ng 60php from session. ok ang view ng mga ex mining caves dito. huli kong punta dito nun e may mga bata pang nag lilimos. ngayon wala na sila. dito ok rin mamili ng mga pasalubong.. super daming stalls na mabibilhan. masarap mais na ihaw here! Camp John Hay - sa peoples park pa ang sakayan nito. scout barrio ang sasakyan mong jeep 8.50 ang pamasahe ata. kung ayaw mo edi mag taxi ka. sa john hay matatagpuaan ang magandang The Manor grabe ang ganda(masarap din daw steak dito).. dito rin matatagpuan ang bilihan ng mga PEX goods na mura! hehehe.. maganda ang adidas at nike collection dito. dito rin makikita ang butterfly sanctuary na di ko ala kung bakit meron sa baguio samantalang ang butterflies ay mas gusto sa mga lugar na 30degree celsius ang init. ok mag picnic dito sa john hay (5php per head alam ko). Burnham Park - 60php ang boat ride(tama ba?) makikita to sa heart of the city hehehe. daming miryenda sa tabi tabi. ok din mag lakad lakad. SM Baguio - kakaibang SM to! hindi mukhang shoe box! may halaman!!! walang aircon! baligtad nga e, pag pumasok ka sa n=mga shops, warm ang temp.. hehehe tapos lamig sa labas here are some weird tips ng pag punta sa baguio: - kung mag bibitbit ka ng pinamili mo from manila na galing sa grocery e sa sm baguio ka na lang bumili, atleast mas konti dala mo papunta(like shampoo, soap, chips, bread...) - kung marami kayo, mas ok mag travel ng taxi/fx.. kung 2 lang kayo may ok mag jeep! mura na, adventure pa sa pag tatanong at pag hahanap! hehe parang amazing race ang dating! -better to wear rubber shoes, or kahit anong comfy na sapatos. for sure mag lalakad ka kasi. -jacket or anything that you can wear that will keep you warm is a must that is if di ka sanay sa lamig. (pero ang sarap ng lamig ng baguio hindi parang aircon lang kaya nung nandun ako naka jeans at shirt lang ako e.) -don't be afraid na mag try ng food. masarap ang local food nila promise.(ewan ko sa iba, pero mahilig kasi akong kumain) - dont be shy na mag tanong, locals here are very very nice. climate may be cold but people here are very warm.. naks!parang slogan lang!
